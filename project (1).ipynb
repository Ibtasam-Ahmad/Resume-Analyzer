The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to create an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about how much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational risks banks face. In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk and capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves appropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.  The New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital requirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage (CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are Simple VaR if the collateral is eligible. If the collateral is ineligible then the Wholesale loan approach will be utilized or the collateral will be reduced to zero in the Simple VaR. .

WAAS combines Cisco's Wide Area File Services (WAFS-products allow remote office users to access and share files globally at LAN speeds over the WAN) with WAN optimization inside of a router, accelerating TCP-based applications on a given network. • WAAS system consists of a set of devices called wide area application engines (WAEs) that work together to optimize TCP traffic over your network. When client and server applications attempt    to communicate with each other, the network intercepts and redirects this traffic to the WAEs so that they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination server. • The WAEs examine the traffic and use built-in application policies to determine whether to optimize the traffic or allow it to pass through your network un optimized • Mainly involves optimizing the various Ao's like HTTP, SSL, HTTPS and functional wise platform check.

Company worked for: HUAWEI TECHNOLOGIES Duration: From Date: 07 Jun 2004 To Date: 18 May 2007 Designation: SOFTWARE ENGINEER  Client: Huawei China  Project 01: DOPRA  Description of the project DOPRA is the platform for telecom products. It is a proprietary platform and has company internal customers. It has main two planes, system management and system service planes and several sub modules. I have successfully worked on the following modules.  Module - MML INI Parser Tool MML is Configuration Tool used in communication equipments This Configuration Tool has set of default and user defined commands. INI Parsing tool is a tool which accepts MML Commands in certain grammar and generates Resource file and Binary File respectively which will be read by server to resister the commands. Involved in the development, testing, verification of the module on windows.    Module - Man Machine Language MML is a configuration tool widely used in communication equipments. It uses Client/Server architecture. MML server communicates with both the client and the APP in the equipment. It receives MML commands inputted by users from the client and relays it to APP to process it. After acquiring the processing result, the server generates a MML report and sends it back to the client. It interacts with other system modules. Connection Management, Authorization Management, Command Process, Data Synchronization, Event Notification, Command Parsing, LOG/ALARM Handling are some of the functions of MML Server. Involved in the development, defect fixing and verification of the module on windows, Linux and vxworks platforms Involved in several release activities.  Module - Configuration Management Configuration Management Module is core module of System Management. Its main function is to define specifications for configuration management interface between the configuration tool layer and the application layer, and provide related configuration command communication mechanism. Any information that can be modified by the user/application and that affects the functionality of the application can be regarded as configurable data. All configuration commands can be sent to Configuration Management Module using a common interface type. Configuration Data Management Module is a supplementary optional component that can be loaded to provide a persistent storage (&amp; retrieval) mechanism for applications\\' static configuration data. Involved in the defect fixing and feature enhancement of the module on windows, Linux and vxworks platforms Involved in several release activities.  Module - TL1 Transaction Language 1 (TL1) is a widely used, \"legacy\", management protocol in telecommunications. It is a cross-vendor, cross-technology man-machine language, and is widely used to manage Synchronous Optical Networks (SONET) . It is defined for operation system/ network element (machine-to-machine) interfaces. TL1 corresponds to the User System Language (USL), which is the language for human-to machine interactions. It is used for managing network elements in a network. TL1 Module is an interface between an Application and Client. Client sends the TL1 Commands to perform some configuration operations in the Applications. TL1 module process the client text TL1 commands according to standard specification TL1 GR 831 and interacts with the Configuration management module and Convert Response messages back to TL1 Response messages Involved in development, verification and customer and release activities. I was a module lead for this project.  Module - QX The Qx interface is a company proprietary application layer protocol between target and the GUI of NMS. By this protocol, NE can communicate with SCC (System Communication and Control) software in different operation system. Each command has defined format. Commands are given in binary form. Qx Module acts as an interface between the Client and Application. Involved in development, verification and customer and release activities. I was a module lead for this project.
